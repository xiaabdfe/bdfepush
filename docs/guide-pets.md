# Pet
Pets accompany you wherever you go when you have them equipped. As you evolve them, they gain stats and skills. You can rename all of your pets as many times as you want.

There are 16 types of pets (4 elements each for 4 groups)

Master Level
* Reflects player's level of experience with pets. In future updates, higher master level will let pets have stronger benefits on the players.

GP
* Like energy/stamina in other games. You consume 1 GP when feeding. Regenerates over time (1 hour per GP, may vary during campaigns).

Evolution Level
* You can evolve pets when the level is maxed. 

Pet Skills
* To be launched in future updates.

# UI
Access pet menu in the middle right of the upper six buttons in your home screen. It is a chomper icon, you can't miss it.

Eggs
* Tap to view your eggs and hatching slots.
* You initially only have 2 hatching slots and you can unlock up to 7 more by using 10 mythrils each.
* When you place an egg into a hatching slot, there'll be a hatching gauge. The egg is hatched when the gauge is full (typically 24 hours).
* Alternatively, you can use mythril or Devotion Fragment to speed up hatching.
* Then, a random type of pet is born. (one of the 16 types)
* If you already own the same pet, you will receive Evolution Feather instead.
* You can only hold up to 9 eggs in addition to the ones placed in hatching slots.

Pet Switching
* You can choose any pet you own to equip. You have to equip the pet to feed or evolve too.

Feeding
* Swipe up to feed. Different pet food costs different resources and gives different amount of experience. There are mythril food, pq food and Pâté.
* Some food are limited for how many times you can feed per day. 
* Feeding consumes GP.

Evolution
* Possible once you hit the max level and possess enough Evolution Feathers.
* At 1-star the pets give no stats, but they start to give stats from 2-star onwards.
* Their appearance change as well.
* You can replace Evolution Feathers with mythril.
