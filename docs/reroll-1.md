* [A Tier](#a-tier)
* [B Tier](#b-tier)
* [Endgame Tier](#endgame-tier)

### Notes
While I list them by effects, take note of the followings:
* The horizontal order of the equipment pictures is the same as the vertical order of the tables.
* When the particular effect is unlocked at skill level 15, i.e. consume 5 legend coins, there will be a legend coin in the equipment picture.
* When the particular effect is a slot effect, the slot number in the equipment picture will appear black.

The tiering is based on early game value while endgame value is rated separately for each gear. Endgame Tier lists the gears you will want eventually as you hit the endgame but not beginner-friendly.

# S Tier

## Phalanx 2

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/IijgGH6V.png)
* Endgame Value: S
* Type: Party Support
* Augments party damage incredibly. Since Phalanx 3 requires mono sets, Phalanx 2 is the one to go.
* Warning: Same Phalanx buffs on other Knights will disappear if you use it.

* Endgame Value: S
* Type: Party Support
* Makes sure that enemies only target you so that the party can perform their own roles safely.

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/8Pj8TyUZ.png)
* Endgame Value: A
* Type: Self Survival

## Hp Up

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/e2G2YtsM.png)
* Endgame Value: B
* Type: Self Survival
* Good to combine with Regen, but not as important in endgame partying because White Mages tend to bring party-wide HP Up buffs.

# Endgame Tier

## Mono Elemental Sets

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/GKu6DAru.png)
* Although support roles do not have to gear elemental to deal damage unlike DPS roles, there are several reasons that they do need to gear mono elemental sets.
	* Easy on BP and reload.
	* There are many support weapons that carry very strong effects that only activate when you gear mono elemental sets.

## Buff Extension

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/54QZpbYv.png)
* Type: Self Maintenance
* Since Knight's strongest buff, Phalanx 3, comes with 30% Max BP penalty each use, it makes your life much easier by extending it instead of trying to reapply throughout the battle.
* When you have multiple buffs, it is just more convenient to keep extending instead of keeping track of each expiry time.
* They all

## Healing Auto

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/gO2xLZ1Y.png)
* Type: Party Support + Self Survival
* Healing auto usually comes with extra aggro generation proportional to healing amount. It is the key in maintaining aggro especially in content where Taunt is not advisable.
* The healing amount helps own survival to a certain extent.
* While choices are limited in regular weapons, similar effects can be found in EX Weapon Limited.

## Non-Phalanx Party Support

![Picture](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/3oGlUlgb.png)
* Command: Usually used in content that extends reload such as Abyss 95 and 100. Warning: It offers nothing to the caster so your buffs may expire faster than your allies without bringing buff extension yourself.
* Testudo: Unclear how effective it is but protection is protection (probably).
* Others: They are not usually used but might help when you have extra slots when partying, especially when your party keeps dying before you.
