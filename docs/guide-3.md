# Character Development
Job Level

* As you level your job, you get AP to spend on Job Asterisk.
* On Job asterisk, you cost AP and elemental crystals to unlock nodes.
* Different nodes have different effects depending on the job.

Mastering Basic Job

* Basic job level goes up to level 99.
* Advanced job is unlocked at basic job level 80.
* Leveling basic job beyond level 80 gives AP for the corresponding advanced job as well.
* You will have exactly the AP needed to unlock all nodes when you hit level 99.
* Some nodes are unlocked by playing other jobs, i.e. some branch in Ranger may need you to hit level 30 on other jobs such as White Mage.

Mastering Advanced Job

* Advanced job level goes up to level 99.
* Some nodes are unlocked  by leveling the corresponding basic job beyond level 80.
* Most nodes require 5-star elemental crystals, which can only be traded with Legend Coins.

	* You have to use special items AP Orbs to get the AP needed.

# Equipment Upgrading
One reason this game is extremely grindy is because there are many ways to upgrade equipment pieces.

## Hammer
* JP: 装備の強化
* Costs: pq, hammers
* Effect: Raise equipment level (and consequently stats)
* Level cap is proportional to current rarity of the equipment piece.
* Using hammers of higher rarity gives more equipment EXP at the same pq cost.
* Auto-hammering is a feature to automatically use system-calculated amount of hammers to hit level cap. The feature prioritizes hammers of higher rarity to minimize pq used. Pros: Save time; Cons: Waste hammers of higher rarity.

Current Rarity | Level Cap
---|---
1 | 20
2 | 30
3 | 40
5 | 80
6 | 99

## Awakening
* JP: 装備の覚醒
* Costs: pq, Brave Coins
* Effect: Higher stats, to unlock additional effect
* Higher base rarity costs more brave coins.
* Higher current rarity costs more pq (i.e. best to awaken before evolving).

## Evolution
* JP: 装備の改造
* Costs: pq, *Evolution Fodders*, Evolution scrolls
* Effect: Higher current rarity; i.e. higher stats and level cap; unlocks additional effects for certain event equipment
* Current rarity is different from base rarity.
* Evolving needs *evolution fodders* and/or evolution scrolls of the same current rarity and same type (weapons, armours or medals), i.e. Evolving a 5-star equipment to 6-star requires 5-star *fodders* or scrolls.
* Evolving higher current rarity requires the amount of evolution materials proportional to the number of stars, i.e. Evolving a 5-star equipment to 6-star requires 5 fodders/scrolls.
* More details on *evolution fodders* later.

## Skill Up
* JP: スキル強化
* Costs: pq, elemental crystals
* Effect: Varies for each piece/skill
	* Armour skills - debuff resistance, reload reduction, skill power
	* Weapon auto skills - BP generation, duration, damage/healing
	* Weapon special skills - BP cost, duration, damage/healing, reload time
* Armour (non-event) skills and weapon auto skills go up to level 5 and weapon special skills go up to level 10.
* Skilling up can fail, success rate lowers as current skill level is higher.
* Higher skill level requires more crystals.
* Auto skilling up is a feature that automatically retries skilling up until you reach the next level successfully or you run out of crystals required.
* Some special skills that level up to 15 consume 5-star elemental crystals, which can only be traded using legend coins.

## Skill Inheritance
* JP: 装備の継承
* Costs: *Skill Fodders*, Skill scrolls
* Details in <a href="guide-5">Inheritance Guide</a>.
