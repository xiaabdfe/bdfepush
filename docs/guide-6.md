# General
Medals are accessories that offer different effects in addition to stats. As of now, there are three main types of medals, monster medals, alchemy-exclusive medals and debuff resistance medals. Medals come with normal and/or set effects. Normal effects are activated by medals individually while set effects only activate when medals are *linked* when you equip them together, i.e. equipping several of the same medals side by side. Medals are only obtained as 1-star.

Monster medals are dropped by monsters scattered around quests and certain events. The numbers of their normal effects differ from medal from medal. For example, normal effect of a Crab Appling (Poison Apple in Japanese) medal is humanoid damage reduction. Its effect ranges among 0%, 1%, 2%, 3% and 5%. When a medal is dropped, it can be any of the five different levels. Depending on the medal, you may want to keep hunting until you collect a set of highest levels.

Alchemy-exclusive medals are only available from medal alchemy event once a month. Their normal effects are fixed (if they have any).

Debuff resistance medals are only dropped by Dapper/Hat Chompers as rare encounters in monthly medal event. Their normal effect improves as you evolve them, up to 6-star. They are unique in how they evolve. Instead of any medals from the same rarity, they use same debuff medals of 1-star rarity to evolve. To have one 6-star debuff resistance medal, you need 16 1-star debuff resistance medals of the same type.

# Monthly Medal Events
The following is true as of now but they are subject to change depending on BDFE's mood. They are usually held monthly. In these events, you can access special medal hunting maps as well as medal alchemy. 

[Special medal hunting maps](https://ringabel.net/chomp/?help/medal-hunt) are maps where every monster with medals show up, separated by elements. However sometimes, not all elements are available at the same time, please refer to game announcements. The medal drop rate of these maps are higher than normal. Dapper/Hat Chompers show up as rare encounters, with guarateed drop of a random debuff resistance medal.

Medal alchemy allows you to put in 3 medals you do not need to get a random medal. They contain all the alchemy-exclusive medals as well as certain monster medals, usually with above-average normal effects. So it is sometimes easier to collect highest levels of normal effects of monster medals via medal alchemy.

# Recommended Monster Medals
It is most recommended to farm during medal event but they are farmable in regular story quests too, with less efficiency. They are also medals you will want to look out for when doing medal alchemy. 

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="25" alt="Water"> Slime
![Slime Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/slime.jpg)

* Max Normal Effect: Matk/Mdef +50
* Set Effect: 5% damage mitigation per link (up to 25% at L.5)
* The general survival medals. While outclassed by family reduction medals, they are easier to farm and versatile. The stats are not high, so not a priority to level. For newbies, it is recommended to just collect 6 first and use them until you can survive without them. Since the normal effect is not very impressive, you can just ignore them.
* Water
* Locations: 3-28, 8-11, 9-9, 9-27, 11-6, 11-36 west, 12-8 north, 13-17

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="25" alt="Water"> Ice Golem
![Ice Golem Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/ice_golem.jpg)

* Max Normal Effect: Special power +35 (up to +210 with 6)
* No Set Effect
* They offer obscene special power with high HP, very high Pdef and high Mdef. Perfect medals for Black Mages since they offer important stats to let squishy black mages to survive hits while adding great power to their special attacks. 
* Water
* Locations: 3-21, 7-3, 9-14, 9-33, 11-2, 11-27, 13-29

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="25" alt="Earth"> Poison Moth
![Poison Moth Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/poison_moth.jpg)

* Max Normal Effect: Auto power +4 (up to +24 with 6)
* No Set Effect
* While they lose to Thief and White Mage Fighting Spirit medals in terms of raw power for auto attack and auto heal respectively, they have high HP, very high Pdef, high Mdef and high Spirit. They are also useable for all jobs so if you want to auto farm stories (for example) in a job other than thief, they are good choices too. 
* Earth
* Locations: 5-4, 5-34, 6-4, 6-21, 7-33, 12-15, 12-19

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Fv9zr7o3.png" width="25"> Chompers
![Silver Chomper Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/silver_chomper.jpg) ![Gold Chomper Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/gold_chomper.jpg)

* Max Normal Effect (Silver): pq obtained +40%
* Max Normal Effect (Gold): EXP obtained +40%
* Set Effect: Rare encounter rate +1% per link
* Although they have different normal effects, they share the set effect (i.e. a mix of silver or gold chomper medals can link together). These chompers are encountered in all non-hammer quests as rare counter, except pq chomper dungeon where only silver chompers appear. They are collected over time and are great asset in amassing pq or raising job levels. However getting +40% is a pain unless by medal alchemy.

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Imvkuj6T.png" width="25"> Family Reduction
![Cerberus Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/cerberus.jpg) ![Knight Dragon Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/knight_dragon.jpg) ![Candiru Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/candiru.jpg) ![Great Bat Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/great_bat.jpg) ![Killer Scorpion Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/killer_scorpion.jpg) ![Dullahan Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/dullahan.jpg) ![Nightmare Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/nightmare.jpg) ![Crab Appling Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/crab_appling.jpg) ![Black Pudding Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/black_pudding.jpg) ![Alrosene Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/alrosene.jpg)

* Max Normal Effect: [Family] 5% damage mitigation (up to 30% with 6)
* They are medals that reduce damage from one specific family each.
* They are better than Slime medals in the long run for higher max reduction and slightly higher stats. In addition, without needing to link, they are more versatile to use. However, they are much more difficult to complete, so it is only recommended to collect them when you have nothing else to do. Or just keep them if you happen to get from medal alchemy.

# Rare Monster Medals
While these are also farmable, they are only available in medal event hunting maps. They are also stronger than regular monsters, so still easier to collect via alchemy.

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Imvkuj6T.png" width="25"> Elemental Dragons
![Salamander Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/salamander.jpg) ![Mizuchi Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/mizuchi.jpg) ![Ladon Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/ladon.jpg) ![Wyvern Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/wyvern.jpg)

* Max Normal Effect: Elemental special power +5
* Set Effect: Debuff resist +10 per link (up to 50)
* These medals are mostly coveted for their debuff resistance. Each elemental dragon resists different debuff. However they are outclassed by debuff resistance medals. 
* Very low stats.

<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="20" alt="Water"> Mizuchi | Burn
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hLKNs6KH.png" width="20" alt="Earth"> Ladon | Poison

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Imvkuj6T.png" width="25"> Limit Break
![Vali Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/vali.jpg) ![Charybdis Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/charybdis.jpg) ![Cyclops Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/cyclops.jpg) ![Sylphid Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/sylphid.jpg)

* Max Normal Effect: Elemental limit break +350 (up to 2100); debuff resist +5 (up to 30)
* Set Effect: Elemental limit break +180 per link (up to 900)
* Limit break is very rare, the effect is only available in medals except certain hats. While these are obtainable in crystal dungeon, it is extremely inefficient to farm there because you clear the quest and exit the dungeon once you defeat one of the bosses. Each elemental limit break resists different debuff.
* While limit break is nice, it depends on whether you can hit the damage cap without power boost from medals. Valuable in hunts where monsters HP is fixed at 10,000.
* Very low stats.

# Alchemy-Exclusive Medals
All of these medals except job medals have low stats. For job medals, the stats are polar that they each have one high stat, and mediocre stats everywhere else.

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Imvkuj6T.png" width="25"> Elemental Power
![Flame Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/flame.jpg) ![Aqua Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/aqua.jpg) ![Earth Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/earth.jpg) ![Wind Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/wind.jpg)

* Normal Effect: Elemental special power +30 (up to 180)
* Set Effect: Elemental auto power +3 per link (up to 15)
* While losing to Ice Golem or Poison Moth in special power or auto power respectively as well as stats, they still pack a punch by boosting both auto and special power. However they are not worth to specially collect and raise at the current stage.

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Imvkuj6T.png" width="25"> Elemental Regen
![Active Flame Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/active_flame.jpg) ![Active Aqua Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/active_aqua.jpg) ![Active Earth Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/active_earth.jpg) ![Active Wind Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/active_wind.jpg)

* They suck. Please skip.

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Imvkuj6T.png" width="25"> Past Ranking Bosses
![Pele Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/pele.jpg) ![Gigas Lich Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/gigas_lich.jpg) ![Albion Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/albion.jpg) ![Mega Chomper Mochi Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/mega_chomper_mochi.jpg)

* Normal Effect: Debuff resist +5 (up to 30)
* Set Effect: Elemental auto power +5 per link (up to 25)
* They are nice double utility medals that provide both debuff resistance and considerable auto power. However low stats and lack of special power mean other auto power medals are superior unless you need the debuff resistance.

The normal effects of these medals are different depending on the job, and only activate if you are in the respective job. They have no set effect. They each have 1 high stat and low stats everywhere else.

Job|Normal Effct|High Stat|Comments
---|---|:-:|---
![Knight](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/4mCTfFw6.gif) | Aggro generation +15%<br>(up to 90%) | HP | Useful when you need that extra push to maintain aggro.
![Black Mage](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/9Cfbpmce.gif) | Limit break +600<br>(up to 3600) | Matk | Probably better to have special power medals unless you can hit cap without them (depends on party setup and boss).
![White Mage](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/DkAtu3w5.gif) | Auto healing power +5<br>(up to 30) | Spirit | While it gives absolute power on auto healing amount, poison moth medals could be more desirable for higher defensive stats while usable for all jobs. Easier to obtain, however.
![Thief](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/K1su7ZFm.gif) | Auto attack power +7<br>(up to 42) | Patk | Absolute destructive power for thieves.
![Ranger](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/PWHtYVMH.gif) | Poison power +4%<br>(up to 24%) | Crit. Rate | General survival medals are probably better.

## <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Fv9zr7o3.png" width="25"> Job Faith
![Knight Faith Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/knight_faith.jpg) ![Black Mage Faith Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/black_mage_faith.jpg) ![White Mage Faith Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/white_mage_faith.jpg) ![Thief Faith Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/thief_faith.jpg) ![Ranger Faith Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/ranger_faith.jpg) 

The set effects of these medals are different depending on the job, and only activate if you are in the respective job. They have no normal effect. They each have 1 high stat and low stats everywhere else. The effects of these medals all activate (with chance) when being attacked.

Job|Set Effct|High Stat|Comments
---|---|:-:|---
![Knight](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/4mCTfFw6.gif) | [20 per link]% to reduce damage by [6 per link]%<br>(Up to 100% to reduce damage by 30%) | HP | Due to their high stats, better than all family damage reduction medals when you are using a full set. However, the effect starts to fall off when you need to slot in debuff resistance medals.
![Black Mage](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/9Cfbpmce.gif) | [15 per link]% to reduce special reload by [10 per link]s<br>(Up to 75% to reduce special reload by 50s) | Matk | Useful when you are having trouble getting specials ready when needed. However you have to receive attacks consistently.
![White Mage](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/DkAtu3w5.gif) | [20 per link]% to buff self with Mind 1 for 15s<br>(Up to 100% to buff self with Mind 1 for 15s) | Spirit | Mind 1 raises both auto and special powers by 50. If being targetted is expected, it can be better than Fighting Spirit medals. However Fighting Spirit, Ice Golem and damage reduction medals are more popular.
![Thief](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/K1su7ZFm.gif) | [10 per link]% to reduce current auto reload to 0 *when evaded an attack*<br>(Up to 50% to reduce current auto reload to 0) | Patk | Arguably useable on situations where auto reloads get extended. However thieves generally do not get targetted as much as other jobs. Note that only thief medals are different from others since they require thieves to evade instead of to get hit.
![Ranger](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/PWHtYVMH.gif) | [15 per link]% to extend debuffs by [2 per link]s<br>(Up to 75% to extend debuffs by 10s) | Crit. Rate | While nice on paper, rangers generally do not get attacked often. Debuff extension bows are usually enough on keeping debuffs on the enemies.

# <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Fv9zr7o3.png" width="25"> Debuff Resist
![Bleed Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/bleed_resist.jpg) ![Poison Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/poison_resist.jpg) ![Blind Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/blind_resist.jpg) ![Waste Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/waste_resist.jpg) ![Seal Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/seal_resist.jpg) ![Burn Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/burn_resist.jpg) ![Slow Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/slow_resist.jpg) ![Stop Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/stop_resist.jpg) ![Bind Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/bind_resist.jpg) ![Stat-down Medal](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/img/medals/status_resist.jpg) 

They are special medals that increase in potency as you evolve them from 1-star to 6-star. However, the trick is that they need copies of 1-star versions to evolve. For example to fuly evolve a Bleed Medal to 6-star, you need 16 pieces of 1-star Bleed Medals.

Rarity | Debuff Resist | Medals to Evolve | Cumulative Number of Medals
---|---|---|---
1 | 5 | 1 | 1
2 | 8 | 2 | 2
3 | 10 | 3 | 4
4 | 12 | 4 | 7
5 | 15 | 5 | 11
6 | 25 | - | 16

They are usually available from event rare encounters or event medal alchemy.
