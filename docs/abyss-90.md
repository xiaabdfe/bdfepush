# Gigant Mole
![Boss](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/TtqG4Jsr.jpg)
* <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Ei5MWQfu.png" width="25"> Water/Undead/Physical
* HP: 1,660,032
* Debuffs: Blind, Slow, Bind, Waste, Bleed, Poison

# Overview
* If done properly, only Knight will be hit.
* Only worry about survival for Knights. The rest just focus on main roles.
* Boss power-up over time, dragging the fight is detrimental.

# Pattern/Threshold

## Phase 1 (Cycle)
* For every "count"
	* The boss will buff itself with invincibility
	* A light puddle will appear for one random member
	* Stepping on the light puddle will dispel boss invincibility
	* The boss will do 2 normal attacks for count 0, 1, 2 and 1 normal attack for count 3
	* First normal attack of every count will dispel all boss debuffs
	* All normal attacks will inflict one of the debuffs listed above
	* After the attacks, a barrier tile will appear for everyone
	* You will see the barrier count beside your name increases by 1 each count
	* Note: Delay between each count is different, by length of delay: 0 > 2 > 1 > 3
* At count 4
	* Gigant press that deals 99999 damage to whole party
	* A quarter of damage is reduced by each barrier tile collected
	* I.e. Collect all four tiles to survive
	* Then, barrier count is reset to 0 and the cycle starts again
* If someone dies, boss normal attack will dispel all buffs, making it impossible to proceed

## Phase 2
* ~820k HP
* 地団駄 (Rampage)
	* Only once per battle during start of phase 2
	* Dispel all buffs and reduce whole party HP to 1
	* Knights usually start with keysword, then buff / heal own HP until next barrier tile
	* White Mages must take note of boss HP and dispel Bleed and Poison before Rampage
	* White Mages usually cast Sakura first for knight to survive first attack
* It is beneficial to change phase at count 4 so there is bonus time for DPS to deal damage during Gigant Press + Rampage, as well as more time for White Mages and Knights to heal back after Rampage
* Cycle remains largely the same as Phase 1 except:
	* First normal attack of every count is now AoE
	* Knights usually stand in the front row at the start
	* The rest usually stay in the middle row
	* After taking the first hit, knights return to the rest to catch heal/buff
	* There are now 2 light puddles, one being "Correct" one being "Wrong"
	* As you step in a light puddle, the other light puddle disappears
	* Stepping on the correct light puddle dispels invincibility
	* Stepping on the wrong light puddle cuts own HP by half of Max HP and invincibility stays
	* Knights usually avoid light puddles unless they are confident that they will not die

# Tips
* Job Difficulty: Black Mage < White Mage < Thief < Knight < Ranger
* It is generally aimed to cross threshold at the first count 4
	* Standard DPS are usually most comfortable with that timing
	* There is a large window for nuking between count 4 -> Gigant Press -> Rampage and idle time after Rampage is longer
	* It is best to cross Rampage as soon as possible because it can be difficult for the Knight to survive after too many power-ups
* The time between battle start and first Gigant Press + Rampage is about 90s. So Knights and DPS roles need to be mindful of their buff durations (depends on extension).

## Knight
* Bind and waste immunity
* Bleed and poison only without sacrificing endurance
* Nier / Tuna auto to maintain aggro
* Try to maintain Phalanx, especially during the Gigant Press + Rampage window
* Generally recommended to use Phalanxes from the start, and then extend 1 time to last until the end of Gigant Press + Rampage

## Black Mage
* Pure DPS
* Resist helps to relieve Knights and White Mages burden
* Auto-buff helps to build up Matk during invincibility
* Need a bit of practice to get used to your cast time
* Be careful when using Dualcast after Rampage as the attack window gets smaller

## White Mage
* Sakura helps during phase transition and quick heal
* Holy Dragon works wonder if mono-fire
* Otherwise must time the phase change at count 4 so Knight can be healed in time
* Maximize DPS to end the fight as fast as possible because of Power-Up
* If DPS cannot keep their buffs up, bring buff extension and extend 2 times before Rampage

## Thief
* Pure DPS
* Bring Assault if paired with Black Mage
* Since you will not get hit, Dagger Stance is very useful
* Auto-buff (Road of Edge or Grande) helps too if you switch well, especially not to cross Rampage at wrong timing

## Ranger
* Time Weakness during the first normal attack of every single count
* Forceless in case of wrong light puddle in phase 2
