# Bosses
There are two main types of bosses: event and abyss hole. At high level you usually have to do event bosses regularly to clear missions.

Event bosses are, well, events. They differ from event to event with rotating element, family and patterns. It is good to know the pattern beforehand to prepare for debuff resistances etc before you fight. High DPS is usually preferred since you may want to do the event bosses multiple times per day for daily missions. There are different difficulties for event bosses:

Difficulty | Japanese
---|---
Easy / Lower | 初級
Intermediate / Medium | 中級
Hard / Upper | 上級 |
Extreme / Super | 超級
Nemesis / Evil | 強敵/凶級
Challenge | 挑戦状

While the rest are done in daily basis, Nemesis / Evil / Challenge are significantly more difficult and require much more developed team and strategy to beat. 

Abyss hole is a set of progressively stronger stages, with bosses appearing every 5 floors. You get 3 attempts per day (reset 0:00 UTC+9) for floors you have not cleared. You get unlimited attempts for cleared floors, however. For abyss hole, you can bring AI support members from your guild. It is good to borrow strength to clear regular encounter floors or early boss floors.

# Aggro
Aggro (敵視) is a term that gauges how likely you will be targetted by the enemy. Aggro is increased by various actions you execute. In general, strongly damaging specials and strong heals tend to gather aggro. A good knight aims to take as much aggro as possible by various means to serve their role as a tank. Unless you are specifically told to face tank (i.e. not moving no matter what), it is important to know about red markers, red tiles and baiting. There are three types of targetting by bosses: fixed floor pattern, single red marker and full team red markers.
* Red markers are "targets" Of the enemy. Like how blue marker is the target of your attack. It is important to pay attention to whether there is red marker, and who the red marker falls on. 
* Red tiles are where the attack of the boss is going to land. You are meant to dodge them unless you are absolutely sure it is safe to tank the attack. Depending on the boss, red tiles can be lethal.

The next action of the boss can usually be predicted by the following:

* When you see no red markers, it can mean the boss is going to execute fixed floor pattern attacks. You will see a pattern of red tiles on the floor. Depending on the boss, you may want to wait to dodge the red tiles.
* When you see full team red markers (i.e. a red marker on everyone). It means a whole party attack that cannot be dodged is coming. There will be no red tiles.
* When you see a single red marker, it means the boss will either do normal attack, or land (often lethal) red tile to the floor (or area/row/etc) where target is currently standing on. There are several points to take note you see a red marker is on you:
	* You want to move to a row far away from the rest of your allies, in case when the boss does a row of red tile, you will not drag your allies into danger. This is called baiting.
	* You want to be alert to move back as soon as you see the normal attack is executed or more importantly, when red tile has activated so you will not be hit.

# Gearing (In-Depth)
Please refer to <a href="guide-2#how-to-gear-basic">Beginner's Guide: Just Started</a> for more basic and general information. 

Bosses usually have debuffs that can be either just annoying or fatal to the success of the boss run. It is important to know what debuffs the boss has and which to prioritize guarding against. Sometimes it is worth wearing an off-element for debuff resistance, depending on what options you have. But too many off-element pieces can be detrimental. In most cases, the more damage you can deal, the easier the boss runs are. Some bosses even require you to deal enough damage in a given time. All roles try to boost party damage in their own way.

As the roles of each job are different, the following sections will explain what each job should focus on and some general tips in battles.


***
## Knight
### Weapons
Knights aim to be targetted, survive and maintain Phalanx to boost party DPS. There are two ways to be targetted: taunt and aggro.

For **taunt**, all taunt swords come with 10-minute penalties. Therefore you cannot spam as much as you like while suffering the said penalty. To effectively use taunt, you have to partner with a Ranger that is able to extend the taunt indefinitely since taunt is also a debuff. Also, you have to know when debuffs are cleansed to reapply taunt. Therefore knights have to think carefully before resorting to taunt.

For **aggro**, there are many factors involved. Firstly, how effective knights can gather aggro depend on how deveoped Paladin asterisk is. Various autos and specials carry aggro manipulation too. **Self heal auto** is the most powerful among the aggro manipulation techniques. However so far only Rose Sword, Zeroth Type (Nier) Sword and Tuna Sword carry self heals in addition to EX Slot 2 weapons. There are some bosses that aggro does not work very well, however.

When being targetted is no longer a problem, you have to survive. Especially since you will be mostly baiting away from the rest of the party, you need to somehow survive on your own in some degree. It all depends on the skill of the White Mage in putting buffs in perfect timing. Regen and HP Up are great assets in this case.

Then finally, put up **Phalanx** to increase damage output of your allies. Sometimes it is more important to put up Phalanx than to take aggro and tank. Always try to put at least a Phalanx 2 and maintain it as long as possible. 

The currently most popular set is the **Mono Wind set**. Tuna Sword and Bone Sword for Phalanx 3 and 2 respectively, followed by Keysword and/or Bleach Sword for survival. Tuna Sword is used for self heal auto too. Glitzy Sword is also a core of this set to extend the expensive self buffs. With enough reload and BP reduction, Glitzy Sword can be used to extend those buffs indefinitely. Sometimes Phalanx 1 from 3-star can be included too. While Phalanx 3 is also possible with mono fire set, lack of buff extension makes mono wind easier to use.

Otherwise one should include a way to get targetted, Phalanx 2, Heal/Regen, HP Up and Phalanx 1 if possible, as a general guideline.

**Choice of Auto**: Self heal auto is the best for aggro generation, followed by auto buff for survival. Attack autos that offer aggro bonus are next candidates.

### Armours
* Hats: General BP and reload reduction. Debuff resistance if pants are not sufficient.
* Chests: If self healing auto is used for aggro, some form of auto power (not just attack power) is preferable. Otherwise BP and reload reduction are ideal.
* Pants: Debuff resistance.

### Medals
Slimes, family reduction and Knight Faith are most often used. Debuff resistance when pants do not offer enough. If aggro generation is insufficient, Knight Fighting Spirit is used too.

### Battle Tips
If you are speed running, starting with Phalanxes are usually recommended. If you are taunting, starting with taunt might be good. Otherwise, starting with HP buffs, then Regen might be beneficial. After buffs are up, you can use Glitzy to extend them. With enough reload reduction and BP supply you may even extend buffs indefinitely with Glitzy.

It helps to get familiar with the flow of the battle such as the timing of the enemies attacks. Know when it is safe to use specials without getting nuked. While you should focus on baiting, make sure to return to White Mage whenever you can to pick up heals and buffs.

## Black Mage
Black Mages are DPS, so their main objective is to deal as much damage as possible in the given time, i.e. improve DPS. 

### Weapons
Although depending on the BP supply from the White Mage(s), it is always helpful to include an **Aspir** rod. Then, check if there are multiple enemies for the boss. If so, try to put in **Split/Concentrate** rod. If bosses hit hard, it is good to slot in **Resist** rod, especially if you or teammates find trouble surviving. Even if you don't have the 5-star version, 3-star resist rods of correct elements are highly valuable. If it is still difficult to survive or no resist rods available, **Magic Barrier** is a solid choice.

Next up is for DPS maximization. 2-hit nuke rods, Fast Cast rods and Dualcast rods are good in that order. Limit Break is situationally good too. However as a DPS, try to limit the use of off-elemental rods.

**Choice of Auto**: [Self buff auto](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/flist/U3BiJmo6.png) is the most recommended especially when black mages usually do not have auto power inherited. 

### Armours
* Hats: Reload reduction is very important, especially if using Aspir. For that reason, Wakoku/Bravo/Vintage hats are highly coveted for black mages.
* Chests: Reload reduction chests are very useful. Otherwise any special power boost is fine.
* Pants: Debuff resistance.

The current meta of Black Mages is to have sufficient reload reduction to have main attacking rods on 0 reload. Therefore it is wise to calculate your reload reduction and look at your Rods reload.

### Medals
Ice Golem. Debuff resistance if pants do not offer enough. Depending on party setup, Fighting Spirit and Faith can also be considered, especially if hitting damage cap.

### Battle Tips
If you have problem surviving the first few hits, starting with Barrier or Resist is advised. Otherwise start with Aspir, followed by Fast Cast. Dualcast -> 2-hit nuke rods combo are very popular. Be mindful of the duration of your buffs, you may want to recast before they run out.


***
## White Mage
### Weapons
Generally, try to have both **Haste** and **Cleanse** unless you are paired with another white mage. Check the attributes of the boss and try to slot in **Pdef and/or Mdef**. Then, check the DPS in your team and try to slot in **Patk or Matk**. Fill up the rest with BP fill, Brave, Revive, HP/BP Up and/or Default. Mono elemental series (mainly fire, earth and wind) are good too if you have enough core books of the said elements. While Braves and Defaults seem powerful, stat buffs may result in better results in the end. A big misconception of the buffs result in many White Mages only bringing Braves/Defaults without corresponding stat buffs. For example, while mono earth set provides Brave 1/2/3 simultaneously, without auto buffing they are not as effective as on paper.

For current meta, it is always better to go mono on books even when not using any mono effects because of BP and reload reduction from armours.

**Choice of Auto**: It mainly depends on the chests the white mages choose. Typically auto buffs can be used for all cases, especially when healing is not needed as much. Otherwise auto heal is used. Avoid auto heal with only 4 BP gain, in general consider these auto heals in order: 5.5s 6 BP > 5s 5 BP > 5.5s 5 BP. Sometimes 2-row auto heal is beneficial too.

### Armours
* Hat: Reload reduction is very important. Try to have at least 90s reduction from hats. Old elemental job hats and Wakoku/Bravo Hats are highly coveted for white mages.
* Chest: Auto heal has very low power without boosts elsewhere. Therefore auto (non-attack) power is highly coveted to boost auto heal so that white mages do not always resort to special for heal. In some cases, reload and BP are also good alternatives. Without sufficient auto power, auto buffs are probably more preferable. If low power books like Sakura or FMA are used, special power can also be considered.
* Pants: Debuff resistance, prioritize seal in most cases.

### Medals
Fighting Spirit, Poison Moth and Ice Golem medals are usually used to augment healing power. In general, Ice Golem medals are used when the books you use have low healing power. Otherwise, Fighting Spirit or Poison Moth are used. Slimes and family reduction are also often used. Debuff resistance when pants do not offer enough. 

### Battle Tips
If you are speedrunning, start with Brave 3, stat-buffs, then other Braves. If the DPS is Black Mage, it helps to put in Haste early. Otherwise starting with HP/BP buffs or/and Proud help to alleviate BP usage if you bring them. 

As a White Mage, the timing of heal and buffs are very important. They are probably more important than the gears themselves. 

* If there is a Knight or someone else baiting. It helps to know when they will be back so you can time your cast to buff them. For example, start casting slightly before red tiles appear allow them to pick up buffs when they are dodging the red tiles.
* When there are four red markers, it means a party attack is incoming, preparing heal or cleanse depending on the boss helps. If you have strong auto heal, you can just auto heal it off though.
* If you cannot predict who is the boss's next target, you must know when it is safe to use specials. In general, it is when the boss just put red marker on someone else. 


***
## Thief
Thieves are DPS, so their main objective is to deal as much damage as possible in the given time, i.e. improve DPS. 

### Weapons
While thieves can deal damage with both auto and special, auto is usually the superior choice resulting from available gears and buffs of thieves. Depending on the animation, auto is faster too. Always have **Shadow 2** and **Quick 2**. Then, try to slot in Shadow 1, followed by Quick 1, depending on what daggers available without resorting in too many off-element or 3-star daggers. Focus is used when you have confidence what you can pull off the BP burn.

There is a new buff called **Dagger Stance** that makes auto attacks insanely powerful if you can dodge all attacks. They are usually paired with **Dodge 2** to decrease the chance of you getting hit. With Dagger Stance, prioritize Quick buffs over Shadow buffs.

**Choice of Auto**: Since thief is highly auto-reliant, the choice of auto is very important. It depends on whether the thief can hit damage cap in 1 or 2 lines. Without hitting damage cap, the fastest one is the best. Dark Angel, Nier, Glitzy are the fastest autos with 3.5s, as well as elemental daggers (50% to reduce next auto by -0.5s). Then, standard 4s autos are used. If attack cap is hit, one may consider 2-line or 3-line daggers. If enemy has high evasion or inflicts blind, you may want to have a 100% aim dagger such as Tanabata, King's, Spiritual, Glitzy or EX Slot 2 daggers.

### Armours
* Hat: Try to have an old job hat (slot effect: auto daamge +20%) on. Limit break hats are nice if you hit the damage cap. If you are using Focus, hats with auto BP generation or BP cost reduction are nice too.
* Chest: Maximize auto (attack) power.
* Pants: Prioritize auto reload reduction. Try to have at least -0.6s on slot 1. Debuff resistance only when you must.

### Medals
Fighting Spirit. Debuff resistance if pants do not offer enough and only when you must.

### Battle Tips
If you have problem surviving or plan to use Dagger Stance, start with Dodge. Otherwise, start with Dagger Stance/Shadow 2/Quick 2. If you are using a Focus build, you can wait for BP and buffs from White Mage to accumulate before starting to buff yourself. Try not to buff Shadow/Quick too early and let them expire while you are on Focus.

The general timings of Focus:
* You stored enough BP to last the rest of the battle.
* Your BP is almost full.
* A White Mage is dedicated to fuel your Focus.

## Ranger
### Weapons
First, check if the boss self buffs. If so, insert **Dispel** bow. **Weakness** is important to bring out party DPS. Then, consider Stat-down, Slow, Slowcast to improve party survival. Finally, **Debuff Extension** bow is very helpful to ensure that the debuffs stay on, especially if there's a knight who uses taunt.

**Choice of Auto**: Bows that inflict poison are usually preferred. While a majority of the bows offer similar BP and speed, bows that offer 5 BP per auto are top choice, such as King's, Space Military and Anchemical. Otherwise, bows with faster autos are usually chosen.

The current most popular set is **Mono Water Set**, with Weakness 3 from Squirrel as the core, then King's bow for Weakness 2, Compass for Slow/Slowcast/Extension, Space Military for stat-down and Watergun for dispel. While Weakness 3 is also possible with mono fire set, extension being only on Chaser and Limited bows makes mono water more versatile. For Weakness 3 of mono earth set, lack of stat-down and debuff efficiency make them inferior to mono water set. **Mono Wind Set** is also very well-balanced and powerful but wind Weakness 3 is a limited bow.

Chaser is good to replace or combine with Weakness if slot available, especially when the DPS is a Black Mage.

For current meta, it is always better to go mono on bows even when not using any mono effects because of BP and reload reduction from armours.

### Armours
* Hats: BP and reload reduction.
* Chests: BP and reload reduction.
* Pants: Debuff resistance.

### Medals
Slimes and family reduction are most often used. Debuff resistance when pants do not offer enough. Limit break or Ice Golem medals are sometimes used if survival or resistance are more than sufficient.

### Battle Tips
Generally start with stat-down buffs followed by Weaknesses, especially when stat-down buffs have longer duration or carry Hawkeye. If you are speed running, the order of Weakness 3 -> Weakness 2 -> stat-down -> Weakness 1 is fine depending on what you bring. If the boss is known for its aggressiveness you may start with Slow/Slowcast. After all debuffs are up, spam extension for the rest of the battle. If you do not carry extension or not enough reload reduction to carry it out, be conscious of when the debuffs would start to expire.

If the boss cleanses its debuffs at fixed timings, you may want to gauge your BP supply and save BP for when the boss next cleanses its debuffs. You probably do not want to empty your BP right before the boss cleanses all of your previous effort.

The timing of Ranger dispel is very tricky. You must accurately know when the Boss is going to buff itself, or standby to do it. Preferably you want to dispel before the boss lands its next attack. Late dispels are often fatal to the party. 

# Final Notes
While debuff resistances are important, please do not overprioritize them. Only guard against the debuffs that you feel you must, because debuff resistances are usually sacrifice to survival or DPS, which end up detrimental to their purposes. For example, you are never going to survive well wearing two off-elemental armour pieces plus six debuff resistance medals compared to full elemental armours and some damage reduction medals. You would rather expose yourself to debuffs than to die in two hits. This is especially true for thieves because sometimes there is no space for debuff resistance if you want to have reasonable damage output. Gear resistances only when you absolutely must.

Also try not to stress out when bossing because BDFE is ultimately a game. Have fun in the process, regardless of winning or losing.
