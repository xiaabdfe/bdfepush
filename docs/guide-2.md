# Account Binding
If you are content with this game / account and would like to keep your account, you have to bind it. Do this as soon as possible unless you don't mind losing the account.

# Knowledge is Power
While there is a lot of information in this section, you do not need to remember all of them. The lists are mostly for references whenever you happen to need them.

## Element
Four elements in this game. The weakness relationship is as follows: Fire > Wind > Earth > Water > Fire.

Element | Japanese
---|---
Fire | 火
Water | 水
Earth | 土
Wind | 風

All weapons and armours have elements. All monsters also have elements (except the current final boss in abyss, which you do not have to worry about yet). It is important to gear against the monster you are facing, e.g. gearing fire to fight wind monster.

## Family
Some equipment effects have advantage against certain family of monsters. All monsters have families. All enemy players (in PVP) are considered humanoid.

Element | Japanese
---|---
Demon | 悪魔
Insect | 蟲族
Beast | 獣族
Humanoid | 人型
Aerial | 飛行
Aquatic | 水棲
Plant | 植物
Inorganic | 無機
Undead | 死霊
Dragon | 竜族

## Stats
Also called parameters. Bread and butter in video games.

Element | Japanese
---|---
Total Power | 総合力
HP | HP
BP | BP
Physical Attack | 物攻
Physical Defense | 物防
Magical Attack | 魔攻
Magical Defense | 魔防
Aim | 命中
Evade | 回避
Mind/Spirit | 精神
Critical Rate | クリ率
Critical Power | クリ威

Most stats are quite literal. Mind/Spirit affects the following:

* Healing amount and amount being healed.
* (Black Mage) Magic Barrier endurance.
* (Ranger) Poison damage.

Total power is calculated based on all your other stats except BP. A certain amount of total power is sometimes required to enter some quests.

## Buffs
There are three main types of buffs. Blue buffs are usually stats increment, stacking up to a certain percentage depending on the stats. Green buffs of the same level overwrite when recasted, but different levels stack. For example, Default 2 stacks with Default 3, but if Default 3 is casted again it will only replace the existing Default 3. Yellow buffs are boss-only buffs that cannot be dispelled. *See also: [Status Effects](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/?guide_effects), [Status Effects (Visual)](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/?effects_shiny).*

## Debuffs
There are two types of debuffs. Red debuffs are usually stats decrement and always overwritten when reapplied. *See also: [Status Effects](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/?guide_effects), [Status Effects (Visual)](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/?effects_shiny).*

Purple Debuffs that have no levels, and thus do not stack:

Debuff | Japanese
---|---
Taunt | 挑発
Bind | バインド
Blind | 暗闇
Stop | ストップ

There are special penalties that cannot be cleansed unless by dying and getting revived. There are no icons and usually last for 10 minutes. 

* Max BP reduction
	* Reduce a percentage of current max BP for the duration. 
	* Penalties from Chain Sword, Elemental Taunts, Phalanx 3 for Knights as well as Quartz Book and Spiritual Book for White Mages.
* Reload/BP penalty
	* Increase special reload and BP cost of all specials
	* Penalties from AoE Taunt for Knights.

Special Debuffs are debuffs that have a special deep purple icon to the left to your name. They cannot be removed normally. Sometimes they can be removed by dying and getting revived but bosses tend to reapply quickly.

Debuff | Japanese | Effect
---|---|---
Trial | 試練 | Receives heavy damage if not meeting certain criteria.
Doom | 死亡宣告 | Death when timer hits 0.
Blind (Special) | ブラインド | HP bar becomes hidden.

Curse | 呪詛 | Receive damage proportional to max HP over time.

Iconless debuffs are also special debuffs but do not have any icons to identify. Their potency varies from boss to boss without a clear indicator. Otherwise they behave the same way. While most are literal in what they do, Power-Down (パワーダウン) results in permanent decrease of all stats as well as increase in auto and special reload time.

Debuff | Japanese
---|---
Max HP Down | 最大HP-
Max BP Down | 最大BP-
Auto Reload Increase | 通常リロード+
Special Reload Increase| 必殺リロード+
Power-Down | パワーダウン

## Tile Effects
Tile effects are effects of the terrain that activate depend on where you stand. Sometimes boss applies tile effects for the whole field. They usually have different visual effects on the ground.

Tile Effect|Visual Appearance|Effect
---|---|---
Burning Tiles | Red/Blue/Violet flames | Receive damage over time proportional to current Max HP. Damage over time increases if under the debuff Burn.
Poison Tiles | Green bubbles | Inflict poison periodically up to 5 stacks. Poison immunity works.
Blind Tiles | Black clouds | Inflict blind periodically. Blind immunity works.
Slow Tiles | Spider webs | Inflict slow periodically. Slow immunity works.
Doom Tiles | Black glow | Inflict doom. Disappears once inflicted.
Reverse Tiles | Pink (taller) flame | Refer to Abyss floor 85 for details.

### Notes
For BP and reload related percentage increase and reduction from various effects, they are relative to the original amount of the skills, not the ones you see on your battle screen.

# Equipment
## Categories
As mentioned, there are three main categories of equipment: Weapons, Armours and Medals.

<a href="list-weapons.md">**Weapons**</a> (武器): All weapons come with an auto skill (通常技 lit. normal skill) and at least one special skill (必殺技). You can equip up to five as you unlock the slots in tutorials. Passive effects of all weapons only work on that particular weapon except stat increases. Each job can only equip one weapon category.

Weapon Category | Japanese | Job
---|:-:|:-:
Sword (lit. Great Sword) | 大剣 | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/4mCTfFw6.gif" width="30" alt="Knight">
Rod / Staff | ロッド / 杖 | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/9Cfbpmce.gif" width="30" alt="Black Mage">
Book | ブック / 本 | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/DkAtu3w5.gif" width="30" alt="White Mage">
Dagger (lit. Twin Swords) | 双剣 | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/K1su7ZFm.gif" width="30" alt="Thief">
Bow | 弓 | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/PWHtYVMH.gif" width="30" alt="Ranger">

Weapon skills (auto and special) are further separated into three types: attacking (攻撃), healing (回復) and support (補助). For attacking and healing, they rely on power (威力) to calculate the amount of damage or recovery. Damage is further calculated using your elemental damage bonus and enemy's elemental affinity.

Each skill has different range of targets:

Target | Japanese
---|---
Single | 単体
AoE | 全体
Self | 自身
1 Row | 一列
2 Row | 二列

*Note: 2 Row always means the row you are on and the row in front of you. If you are standing on the front row, it is effectively just one row*

<a href="list-armours.md">**Armours**</a> (防具): Armours offer various passive effects that stack upon each other. All jobs can equip all armour categories but each armour category is designed to be used by one or two jobs. There are event armours with no category, however.

Armour Category | Japanese | Optimal Jobs
---|:-:|:-:
Heavy Armour | 重装 | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/4mCTfFw6.gif" width="30" alt="Knight">
Mystic/Magic Armour | 魔装 | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/9Cfbpmce.gif" width="30" alt="Black Mage"><img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/DkAtu3w5.gif" width="30" alt="White Mage">
Light Armour | 軽装 | <img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/K1su7ZFm.gif" width="30" alt="Thief"><img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/PWHtYVMH.gif" width="30" alt="Ranger">

In addition, armours are split into three parts: head, upper body and lower body. You can equip up to two of each part as you unlock the slots in tutorials. 

Part | Japanese | Common Term
---|:-:|---
Head | 頭 | Hats
Upper Body | 上半身 | Chests
Lower Body | 下半身 | Pants

There are many different types of passive effects that are present in both weapons and armours:

Passive Type | Japanese | Description
---|---|---
Normal Effect | 通常効果 | Inherent effects.
Awakening Effect | 覚醒効果 | Activated only when the equipment is awakened using Brave Coins. 
Slot Effect | 適正効果 | Activated only when the equipment is in the correct slot.
Inherited Effect | 継承効果 | For more information, please refer to <a href="guide-5">Inheritance Guide</a>.
Special Effect | 特殊効果 | Special inherent effects that usually only work on certain tribes.
Event Effect | イベント効果 | Effects that are only active in the current event and disappear once event is over.

The following is some common terms in passive effects for your reference.

# How to Gear (Basic)
The following is just a basic rule of thumb on how to gear. There will be more things to take not as you advance depending on your job. A more comprehensive guideline is in Bossing Guide. First things first, revise the elemental advantage: Fire -> Wind -> Earth -> Water -> Fire

## Weapons
Do not get rid of lower rarity gears until you have complete set of the element of higher rarity. You gain 25% additional elemental damage each piece of weapon of that element you are equipped with. It is always encouraged to weapons of the same element instead of having full set of high rarity gears but different elements. 

There are several 3-star weapons that are handy until you have complete gears of the element too. They are usually completely normal at first glance but unlock useful additional effect once awakened. Note that they come in all elements.

![Swords](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/zdhwxBsp.png)
Phalanx 1, Regen 1, Endure (2 each)

![Rods](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/FF1WA9XS.png)
Elemental Resist of respective elements (wind resist on fire rod) and Elemental Boost of respective elements.

![Daggers](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/gJrwbR3s.png)
Shadow 1, Quick 1, Dodge 1 (2 each)

![Bows](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/sISLQutm.png)
Weakness 1, single-dispel, Forceless 1, single-dispel, Slowcast 1, self-heal

## Armours
Do not get rid of lower rarity gears until you have complete set of the element of higher rarity. Always try to wear armours strong against the enemy. Each piece of armour adds elemental resist to element it is strong against, and cuts elemental resist to element it is weak against, i.e. avoid wearing wind armours against fire enemies.

## Medals
Medals are not obtained by Gacha but only events or monster drops. For starters, it is advisable to gather a set of slimes until you can survive better.
