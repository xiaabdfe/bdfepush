# General
Inheritance is an action to consume a piece of inheritance fodder to add a new effect to the piece of equipment. The inheritance fodder is lost forever after used. However, the inherited effect can be replaced over and over again. The topic of inheritance is very vast and complicated. There are two types of inheritance: skill inheritance and effect inheritance. There is no inheritance for medals.

Scrolls or equipment pieces with the words *Normal Effect* (通常効果) is able to be an inheritance fodder. Note that awakening, slot, special and event effects cannot be inherited. Only weapons with base rarities of 4 or 5, and armors with base rarities of 5 can inherit effects (except event equipment which depends on BDFE's mood at the time). Refer to <a href="guide-2#equipment">Beginner's Guide: Just Started</a> for various Japanese text.

# EX Weapons
Skill inheritance is only possible for EX Weapons. They are special weapons that only come in Elemental Fest Gacha. For more information, refer to <a href="list-weapons#ex-weapons">list of weapons</a>.

They are theoretically very strong but take note of the following:

* They can only inherit special skills of the same element.
* Special skills lose their innate awakening and slot effects after inheritance.

You are also given a set of free samples of 3-star wind EX weapons, but the free samples can only inherit special skills up to base rarity of 3-star.


***
# Armour Inheritance
Armours can only inherit normal effects from other armours or armour inheritance scrolls of the same type, i.e. hats can only inherit normal effects from hats or hat scrolls, same for chests and pants. In some events, you will also get armour inheritance scrolls for hats, chests and pants separately.

## Phantom Chamber / Occult Room
They are a set of permanently available bosses that drop special armour pieces meant for inheritance. 

* You are kicked out as soon as you got game over once (instead of twice like everywhere else).
* You can use guild AI in these chambers.
* You need a phantom key to enter one of the chambers once. 
	* You can only hold up to 3 phantom keys at once.
	* One key is distributed to you directly (not via giftbox) every day at 04:00 (UTC+9) when you have <3 keys in inventory (not counting gift box).
	* Two keys can be purchased daily using 10 Brave Coins each in Brave Coin shop.
	* Higher level yields better drops. However if you are newbie please be careful.
* The normal effects of these armour pieces upgrade by evolving its rarity.
	* The armours are dropped as 3-star.
	* Instead of using any armours of the same rarity, they use same pieces of armour at 3-star rarity to evolve.
	* It takes 13 pieces of the same armour pieces to have a 6-star inheritance fodder.
	* If you do not need the specific piece for inheritance, it is recommended to stop at 5-star to use as evolution fodders for your gacha armours instead.
* For specific boss drops, please refer to [this page](https://ringabel.net/bdfe/?armor_key).

## Vintage Armours
![Vintage Armours](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/myh3blyc.png)

Vintage armours are are special armours that have **two** effect inheritance slots instead of one. They are highly valuable for beginners for their versatility, especially when combined with Phantom Chamber. For more information, refer to <a href="list-armours#vintage">list of armours</a>

## Hats
The rule of thumb is to inherit **special reload -30s**. In addition to Regina from Phantom Chamber, they are also available in 3-star and 4-star hats that you randomly get from gacha or alchemy:

![-30s Special Reload Hats](https://i.imgur.com/OWRHp63.png)

From left to right: 1. Knight 4-star Hat; 2. Thief 4-star hat; 3. Black/White Mage 4-star hat; 4. Ranger 4-star hat; 5. Thief/Ranger 3-star Hat Male; 6. Thief/Ranger 3-star Hat Female

If these -30s hats are out of stock, -25s special reload from 3-star hats can be used temporarily. Situationally, you can also inherit -35s elemental special reloads or debuff resist. However you have to be absolutely sure of what you are doing.

## Chests
The topic of chest inheritance highly depends on how many different armours available to you. Chest inheritance usually involves skill power such as auto or special. It is important to note which only offer attack power while which offer both. Also be careful not to inherit the wrong element.

Generally, 3-star and 4-star chests come with only auto attack power, while 5-star chests differ from piece to piece. The chests from Phantom Chamber work on both attack and healing skills and thus very valuable. If you are willing to consume 5-star chests, note that most 5-star chests only work for those particular jobs except some newer 5-star chests. There are also newer pieces with debuff resistances.

General Farming

* Elemental auto attack power. Since 4-star chests give +35 attack power, they are recommended for inheritance.

[Reload Reduction Chests](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/DwHnvVRa.png)

* Generally it is recommended to inherit reload reduction chests with each other if you have extra (more than 2).
* Black Mages can inherit them into Vintage chests.
* Highly valuable even as dupes. NEVER alchemy them.

Knight

* Elemental auto power with corresponding self-heal swords.
* If you have wind Phalanx 3, it is recommended to inherit wind auto power to all elements.
* BP +3 from events is useful otherwise.

Black Mage

* Elemental special power.

White Mage

* Elemental auto power, especially when auto-healing.
* It is also possible to inherit off-element auto power to spare chests in case you need to go mono.
* If you are auto-buffing, BP +3 or special power can be considered.

Thief

* Elemental auto (attack) power.

Ranger

* BP +3 from events is useful.

## Pants
Pants are the main source of debuff resistance. So, in general debuff resistance is inherited. You can easily buy pants debuff resistance inheritance scrolls from Brave Coin shop. Otherwise, Phantom Chamber also offers a selection of dual-debuff resistance fodders.

For thieves, newer pants of auto reload -0.3s are also excellent inheritance fodders. However you need to have the correct candidates such as other -0.3s pants or pants with -0.6s as slot effect.

# Weapon Inheritance
Weapon inheritance effects work for different categories, except family effectiveness series. Past events distributed free weapons with normal effects but nothing for the past few months (depends on BDFE's mood at the time).

## Scrolls
Weapon inheritance scrolls are available from weekly dungeon available from Friday 0:00 (UTC+9) to Sunday 23:59 (UTC+9) for 72 hours. There are two maps for weapon inheritance scrolls, the initial map is filled with Orcs while the map to the right is filled with Succubus. Orcs sometimes spawn Orc Lords while Succubuses spawn Liliths as rare monsters, which give better drops. Orcs and Succubuses are differentiated by elements.

Orcs drop status enhancement scrolls and elements of Orcs do not affect scrolls dropped. Succubuses drop elemental power scrolls of four categories: auto attack power, auto healing power, special attack power, special healing power. Elements of Succubuses affect the element of scrolls dropped. The scrolls vary into five levels (except BP scrolls from Orcs). As of the current stage, scroll dungeon is very inefficient and it can take days to hunt a specific scroll of highest level you want. So it is only suggested when you are well established in other areas. While BP +3 is arguably the best gem of the dungeon, it is very rare and difficult to farm. The potency of the scrolls are as follows:

Stat|I|II|III|IV|V
---|---|---|---|---|---
HP|10|30|50|75|100
BP|1|2|3|-|-
Other stats|10|20|30|50|75
Auto attack power|2|4|6|8|10
Auto healing power|1|2|3|4|5
Special attack power|10|15|20|25|30
Special healing power|5|10|15|20|25

The recommended scrolls are as follows:

General Farming

* Auto attack power, Patk, Matk

Knights

* HP or BP

Black Mages

* Matk
* Special attack power
* BP if not using Aspir

White Mages

* HP or BP
* Special healing power for low power specials

Thieves

* Patk
* Auto/Special attack power
* BP if using special or focus builds

Ranger

* BP

## Other Weapons
There are two types of weapons with normal effects: family effectiveness and universal.

Dual family weapons are weapons that offer some advantage over two certain families. As 4-star rarity weapons, they can be raised into 5/6-stars with decent stats or make good inheritance fodders. Once inherited, they only work on that particular weapon ('s auto or special). Take note that for this type, they can only be inherited into weapons of the same categories, e.g. swords into swords.

Category|Effect against enemies of the specific families
---|---
![Swords](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/ymHyjXhz.png)<br>Swords | Self heal 5% HP during auto attack
![Rods](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/6fS5nN0M.png)<br>Rods | Special power +100
![Books](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/JL1Bz0B0.png)<br>Books | Heal whole team with 10 healing power during auto **attack**
![Daggers](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/bWff66eH.png)<br>Daggers | Auto attack power +20
![Bows](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/pDDKJE5E.png)<br>Bows | Current reload of all specials -2s during auto attack

For universal normal effect, they can be inherited across categories, e.g. books into bows. (If you take note of their Japanese skill titles you might see words related to jobs. However, they can be inherited and utilized by other jobs as per normal.) Like dual family weapons, they only work on that particular weapon once inherited. However some of them are very useful on their own, so be extremely careful before using them as inheritance fodders. These are all 5-star rarity weapons. Only use them after careful consideration. 

Series | Normal effect | Recommendation
---|---|---
![Ancient, Ritual](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/gh2unLqD.png)<br>Ancient, Ritual | Special BP cost -2 | Specials that you spam the most
![Anchemical, King's, Space Military](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/F4NVwOzC.png)<br>Anchemical, King's, Space Military | Auto BP +1 | Autos that you use the most and you have BP issues
![Zeroth Type, Lord](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/IxP9gLuf.png)<br>Zeroth Type, Lord | All stats except BP +20% | Equipment pieces with innately high stats
![Illusion, Legend](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/olist/FXgFIemH.png)<br>Illusion, Legend | Special reload -20s | Specials that you often find trouble with their long reload.
