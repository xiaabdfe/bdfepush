# Sealed Chaos
![Boss](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/bEpkJzvh.jpg)
* Main Body: Non-Elemental/Humanoid
* HP: 2,000,000
* Stones: Fire/Inorganic, Water/Inorganic, Earth/Inorganic, Wind/Inorganic
* Debuffs: Seal, various etc

# Overview
* Main body cannot be damaged nor debuffed
* Main body consumes HP to summon stones, which can then be damaged or debuffed
* Stones can only be damaged by their respective weakness elements
* Stones are the ones that directly deal damage to you, with some red tiles from phase 2 onwards.
* When the main body summons stone(s), it will cast "Mark of (element)", with the element corresponding to one of the stones it summons
* "Mark of (element)" inflicts a special effect onto the party until one of the stones is broken
* "Mark of Water" is the only real threat because it inflicts Curse 5, which reduces 30% HP every few seconds. Priests need to prepare to heal accordingly
* The other marks inflict Blind (HP becoming invisible), Gravity and Death Sentence.
* When stones are active, main body can cast "Blessing" or "Disaster".
* "Blessing" buffs the active stones with Brave/Default (level depends on phase).
* "Disaster" debuffs the party, mainly Seal, additional effect of dispeling buffs from phase 2 onwards.
* The longer a stone stays active, the more its HP increases the next time the same elemental stone is summoned. (Starting HP is 50,000)
* HP of stones stay 50,000 if broken immediately when summoned.
* The more HP a stone has, the more HP reduction the main body will be when it is summoned.
* When a stone stays active for too long, it will explode, turning the remainder of its HP as damage to party.

# Pattern/Threshold

## Phase 1
* No penalties yet.
* Summons 1 stone each "Mark"
* Opening attack can be quite painful for arcanist, so it is advisable for arcanist to enter last and tap start only after the opening attack lands.
* Main body always summons Earth Stone first

## Phase 2
* HP ~1,700,000
* Auto reload increase, special reload increase
* Summons 2 stones each "Mark"
* "Disaster" starts to dispel buffs

## Phase 3
* HP ~1,200,000
* Max BP reduction, special BP consumption increase, auto BP generation decrease (plus penalties above)
* Summons 3 stones each "Mark"

## Phase 4
* HP ~700,000
* Heal reduction (plus penalties above)
* Summons 4 stones each "Mark"

## Phase 5
* HP 1
* "Apocalypse" - dispels buffs and debuffs 5x seals + others, summons 4 stones and buff each of them with Default 3 (plus others that don't matter)
* Stones no longer attack and there are no special effects from "Mark"s
* It is necessary to break all 4 stones to clear at this stage

# Tips

## General
* Job Difficulty: White Mage < Knight < Thief < Black Mage < Ranger
* It is mandatory to achieve permanent buff extension to clear, i.e. buffs never expiring throughout the fight
	* Condition 1: Priests spamming buff extension
	* Condition 2: Arcanist breaking a stone immediately every wave so that main body does not have the chance to use "Disaster" 
* It is common practice to let earth stone stay longer to let its HP grow as well as to give party time to buff, and other elemental stones are broken immediately
* For "Apocalypse" in phase 5, it is mandatory to use Buff Overloading Glitch - a glitch that let some buffs stay even when they are supposed to be dispelled
* Therefore it is mandatory to continuously stack buffs while extending them to make the buff icons appear black, especially for DPS
* Continous buff stacking and buff extension lag the game terribly, but it is necessary
* Stay in back row and never move

## Knight
* Compulsory: Mono wind set with Phalanx 3, Bone (Phalanx 2)
* Recommended: Phalanx 1, Choco (Command 2), Dress Up (Anti-inorganic)
* Others: Glitzy, any auto-buff, party survival buffs
* Focus on reload and wind special power, use ice golem medals
* In a standard party, earth stone is usually the knight's responsibility, hence enough wind DPS to break earth stone is needed (subject to whether the Black Mage or wind White Mage can help with earth stone)

## Black Mage
* Compulsory: Earth or Fire EX with Split/Concentrate and Aspir/Fastcast
* Compulsory: Earth EX rod with 2 Nier rods inherited
* Compulsory: Ancient / Red Quartz Rod, King's Rod, Fire/Water/Earth elemental buff rod
* Inherit special power +100 against inorganic into all nuking rods
* Focus on reload (especially earth) and special power, use ice golem medals
* Continuously buff with elemetal power rod(s) in phase 1 while breaking wind/fire/water stones immediately
* Use split/concentrate right before phase 2 starts, and sometime again in phase 4 (so that it is more likely to disappear during "Apocalypse")

## White Mage
* Seal Immunity
* Extreme reload reduction
* Reload calculation: original reload written on skill x 2 and then apply reload reductions from weapon and armour effects
* 0 reload on haste books helps, although not absolutely needed
* Compulsory: Brave 3, Brave 2, ALL of HP/BP/Patk/Matk/Pdef/Mdef/Spr buffs, Haste 2, Cleanse, BP recovery, Buff extension
* Recommended: Default 3, Default 2, Brave 1
* Fill the rest with: Default 1, Proud 2
* Revive is useless because it is impossible to rebuff in time
* Use ice golem medals to relieve healing in phase 3/4
* In phase 1, start spamming blue buffs when green buffs are up, while extending all the time
* Start focusing on extension when you think the buffs are thick enough
* From phase 2 onwards, focus on haste and extension, restore BP occasionally since auto generation will not be enough
* Be exta careful during "Mark of Water", curse 5 is extremely painful with HP buffs

## Thief
* Compulsory: row Shadow 3, row Shadow 2, wind nukes
* Recommended: party/row Shadow 1, Ranbu 2
* Focus on reload and wind special power, use ice golem medals
* Since Thief replaces Knight in the standard setup, earth stone is Thief's responsibility

## Ranger
* Compulsory: Rinne Bow (AoE Weakness 3), Fish Bow (AoE Weakness 2), Glitzy Bow (AoE Dispel)
* Compulsory: Godly reload, connection speed and timing
* Focus on reload and wind special power, use ice golem medals
* Basically you need to time your debuffs between stones showing up and Black Mage's nuke
* Need multiple copies of Rinne Bow / Fish Bow to actually debuff at least Weakness 2 every wave
* Typical to spam Quartz Bow after the three bows above to break earth stone during "Apocalypse" (240s reload reduction needed with Haste 2)
