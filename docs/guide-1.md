# Jobs
## Knight
![Icon](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/DzwVhcPG.jpg) JP: ナイト/騎士

Tank with a lot of playstyles depending on weapons. 

The main job of knights is to be targetted by enemies and to bait the attacks away from the party. How likely you are to be targeted is gauged by a term called *aggro*, related to how much hate you can generate from the enemies. There are also other amazing party support available to knights.

## Black Mage
![Icon](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/K3fS0cXo.jpg) JP: 黒魔道士

Magical DPS with strong and some AoE special attacks. 

Black mage's rods usually provide buffs that augment own or party damage. They have unparalleled damage in terms of AoE. AoE attacks usually have their damage split among all targets, but Black Mage has Concentrate to negate that to deal full damage. All spells come with casting time, so timing is important. Also black mages are fragile to physical attacks. It is also a fun and challenging job.

[Element] Power | Increase damage dealt using a specific element.

## White Mage
![Icon](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/4XlIsPl2.jpg) JP: 白魔道士

Healer and Buffer. Essential in all hard contents. A challenging job in many aspects.

White Mage has a tough job that not only to keep allies alive, but also to buff them, shorten reload time with Haste, cleanse debuffs and supply BP. All spells come with casting time, so White Mage has toavoid killing themselves or killing allies when casting. Also, all buffs have varying duration. Hence, there are a lot of information to keep in mind when playing. Hence it is very challenging but rewardingto become a good white mage.

Haste | Shorten special reload time. Further reduce remaining cooldown counter every time the buff is refreshed.
Brave | Increase damage dealt.
Default | Decrease damage received.
Proud | Reduce BP cost of special.

## Thief
![Icon](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/MGL6i8bK.jpg) JP: シーフ

Physical DPS with fast and strong auto attacks.

Thief's daggers usually provide buffs that augment own or party damage, or evasion. Thief has naturally high evasion, so boosting that makes them harder to be hit. Since thief's main strength is auto attacks, daggers that give Shadow/Quick/Focus buffs are popular.

Buff|Effect
---|---
Shadow | Deal follow-up damage for all auto attacks.
Assault | Deal follow-up damage for all special attacks.

## Ranger
![Icon](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/nzsSH0OO.jpg) JP: 狩人

Debuffer that also deals some physical / magical / DoT damage. Important in most hard contents.

Ranger's main job is to dispel enemy buffs while inflicting debuffs to turn the battle to the party's favour. Since debuffs usually have short duration, there are debuff extension bows to extend debuffs already inlicted on the enemy.

Buff|Effect
---|---
Poison Up | Increase poison damage.
Hawkeye | Increase debuff duration.

# Gacha
Gacha are split into mythril gacha and ticket gacha. In this game, you gacha for equipment, <a href="list-weapons">weapons</a> and <a href="list-armours">armours</a> specifically. There is a third type of equipment called medals (accessories) but are not from gacha, you do not have to worry about it for now.

## Mythril Gacha
Mythril is the premium currency in this game, where it is split into free mythril and paid mythril. Mythril gacha is always separated by jobs, meaning you will only get what the job can use.

The general gacha rate is as follows unless stated otherwise:

* Separated by job: 64% 3-star / 30% 4-star / 6% 5-star
* While the contents of 3-star and 4-star are more or less fixed (mostly fodders). The contents of 5-star vary from gacha to gacha.

*Gacha events change from time to time, the following is true for the time when this guide is written.*

Job Gacha/Fest

* 3% evenly distributed among WEAPONs released
* 3% evenly distributed among ARMOURs released
* Job Gacha is permanently available while Job Fest is an event
* During Job Fest, for doing a 10-pulls, the first pull will be a guaranteed 5-star, but only available once a day.
	* 50% evenly distributed among WEAPONS and ARMOURS released respectively

Elemental Fest

* Same as Job Gacha / Fest but contain only equipment for one specific element.
* Chance to get with EX weapons that can inherit 2 specials and 2 normal effects, more about them in Inheritance Guide.

Box Gacha

* All new equipment pieces are launched in the form of Box Gacha.
* 126 3-star, 62 4-star, 8 5-star pieces in the pool.
* 5-star pieces (in general):
	* 1 New Weapon
	* 3 New Armours
	* 1 Old Weapon
	* 3 Old Armours
* Once a piece is pulled, it is removed from the pool. Rate for each piece is always 6% divided by number of remaining pieces.
* Once all pieces of a rarity are pulled, the rarity is removed from the equation. Otherwise, the rate always remains 64% : 30% : 6%.
* There is a red button below the pulling button named Reset. It resets the content of the box to before you start pulling. Only push if you want multiple copies of the same item.

Step Up (Currently obsolete)

* Like a set package of gacha. Freebies, guaranteed 5-star are offered as you pull more to complete the steps.
* May have special pools depending on the gacha. Currently, they are mostly slotted weapons step up (i.e. weapons with slot effects).
* Typically cost 300~500 mythril.
* There is a permanent beginner step-up but it is considered obsolete since other banners are better now.

Vintage Gacha

* The contents of 5-stars are all armours.
* Chance to get Wakoku/Bravo gears that can inherit 2 normal effects.
	* When a 5-star is pulled , 50% to get Wakoku/Bravo gears.
	* Chance is split among Hat/Chest/Pants for all 4 elements, i.e. 12 pieces.
* Rare chance to get time-limited recoloured 5-star armours as 4-star.
	* No practicality, simply for fashion

Paid Mythril

* (Permanent) Daily 1 pull per 5 paid mythril for Job Gacha, with regular rate
* (Event) Guaranteed 5-star per 150 paid mythril in Elemental Fest / Vintage.

## Ticket Gacha
The rate of ticket gacha is unpublished. Tickets in this game yield random items. You may not select a pool to use the tickets on. The currently released recurring tickets:

Ticket|Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Nfy1RNQW.JPG" width="25" alt="Red"> | Used on specific job only, starting from 3-star.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/AkD1BwAI.JPG" width="25" alt="Blue"> | Able to select job, starting from 3-star.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/p7yDjLsZ.JPG" width="25" alt="Gold"> | Able to select job, starting from 4-star.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hbwAox3w.JPG" width="25" alt="Pink"> | Able to select job, 5-star only.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/8Ur4JKfw.JPG" width="25" alt="Green"> | Random jobs, 10 pulls per ticket.

Red and blue are the most common forms of tickets. Gold is received in events regularly, but pink and green are very rare. eku53ru logged the results of red and blue ticket pulls and have the following results: 82% 3-star / 15% 4-star / 3% 5-star.

## Beginner / Reroll

It is easier to get armors later on from boxes or Vintage gacha. Therefore, it is generally suggested to reroll for weapons. 

Reroll Suggestions:
* <a href="reroll-1">Knight</a>
* <a href="reroll-2">Black Mage</a>
* <a href="reroll-3">White Mage</a>
* <a href="reroll-4">Thief</a>
* <a href="reroll-5">Ranger</a>

Every new account starts with 10 random rolls for selected job with 1 guaranteed 5-star. There are also weapon-only and armour-only start-dash with guaranteed 5-star that can only be pulled using 75 paid Mythril. 1 time per job per type per account. The start-dash will only be available for 72 hours after account creation. 

**Beginner Boost**: Please note that within one week of starting, there is a honeymoon period that you get boosted pq drop, rare encounters, item drop rate and EXP gain for a week. It is a good time to quickly catch up when the boost is still going on.

## Alchemy
Technically not a gacha but practically a gacha. There are three types of alchemy. It is not in the gacha tab but in the equipment upgrading tab.

4-star Alchemy

# User Interface
[Gamepedia Beginner's Guide](https://fairyseffect.gamepedia.com/Beginner%27s_Guide) contains pictures and UI translations useful for non-Japanese speakers.

Feel free to ask about anything unclear in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jCRBwmz).

Typically you are in town (named Al Khampis / イスタンタル lit. Istantal) unless you are taking part in something else such as quest, PVP or abyss. [**Town UI 1**](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/MYnu7mRJ.jpg); [**Town UI 2**](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/EpQafnHh.jpg).
