# Jobs
## Knight
![Icon](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/DzwVhcPG.jpg) JP: ナイト/騎士

Tank with a lot of playstyles depending on weapons. 

The main job of Knights is to be targetted by enemies and to bait the attacks away from the party. How likely you are to be targeted is gauged by a term called *aggro*, related to how much hate you can generate from the enemies, more about it in <a href="guide-4.md#aggro>Bossing Guide</a>. There are also other amazing party support buffs available to Knights. Note that Knights' support buffs that affect allies usually do not affect themselves.

Knights can also have fun by solo-ing using Regen and Dueling. 

Buff|Effect
---|---
Phalanx | Raise damage of allies at the same row or behind.
Cover | Take 50% of damage taken on behalf of allies at the same row or behind.
Endure | Survive 1 fatal attack.
Dueling | Reflect damage.

HP Up | Increase max HP temporarily.
Command | When attacked, reduce remaining cooldown counter and extend buff durations on allies.
Testudo | Reduce damage taken of self and allies at the same row or behind.

Debuff|Effect
---|---
Taunt | The enemy can only target you.

## Black Mage
![Icon](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/K3fS0cXo.jpg) JP: 黒魔道士

Magical DPS with strong and some AoE special attacks. 

Black Mages' rods usually provide buffs that augment own or party damage. They have are advantageous facing multiple enemies. AoE attacks usually have their damage split among all targets, but Black Mages have Concentrate to negate the damage reduction to a certain extend. All spells come with casting time, so timing is important. Black Mages are usually fragile to physical attacks, but they have Elemental Resist buffs and Magic Barrier to mitigate that. It is also a fun and challenging job.

Buff|Effect
---|---
Split | Turn all special attacks into AoE.
Concentrate | Decrease damage reduction from splitting due to AoE.
Magic Barrier | Divert a portion of damage taken to an additional HP bar according to your spirit stat.
Fast Cast | Reduce casting time of special skills.
Critical | Increase critical rate.
Limit Break | Raise damage cap.
Levitate | Ignore harmful floor effects.
Dualcast | Execute twice for the next special skill, but the next special skill costs more BP).

[Element] Power | Increase damage dealt using a specific element.

## White Mage
![Icon](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/4XlIsPl2.jpg) JP: 白魔道士

Healer and Buffer. Essential in all hard contents.

White Mages have a tough job that not only to keep allies alive, but also to buff them, shorten reload time with Haste, cleanse debuffs and supply BP. All spells come with casting time, so White Mages have to avoid killing themselves or killing allies when casting. Also, all buffs have varying duration. Hence, there are a lot of information to keep in mind when playing. It is very challenging but also rewarding to become a good White Mage.

Buff|Effect
---|---
Haste | Shorten special reload time. Further reduce remaining cooldown counter every time the buff is refreshed.
Brave | Increase damage dealt.
Default | Decrease damage received.
Proud | Reduce BP cost of special skills.
Mind | Increase healing power of all skills.
Various stat-buffs | -

Debuff Resist | (Armour passive only) Immune to all debuffs temporarily.
Dragon Scale | Reduce damage received from Dragon tribe.
Human Shield | Reduce damage received from Human tribe.
Sky Shield | Reduce damage received from Aerial tribe.

## Thief
![Icon](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/MGL6i8bK.jpg) JP: シーフ

Physical DPS with fast and strong auto attacks (i.e. actually called normal attacks but usually referred as auto attacks to avoid confusion with some other terms).

Thieves' daggers usually provide buffs that augment own damage or evasion. While Thieves are fragile, they have naturally high evasion. Since Thieves' main strength is auto attacks, buffs and equipment that increase auto damage or make auto attacks faster are coveted.

Buff|Effect
---|---
Shadow | Deal follow-up damage for all auto attacks.
Assault | Deal follow-up damage for all special attacks.
Quick | Shorten intervals between auto skills.
Focus | Increase damage for all auto attacks, but BP gain per auto skill is fixed to be -4.

Charge | Increase power of the same special attack for the rest of the battle.

## Ranger
![Icon](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/nzsSH0OO.jpg) JP: 狩人

Debuffer that also deals some physical / magical / DoT damage. Important in most hard contents.

Ranger's main job is to dispel enemy buffs while inflicting debuffs to turn the battle to the party's favour. Since debuffs usually have short duration and/or high BP cost, there are debuff extension bows to extend debuffs already inlicted on the enemy.

Buff|Effect
---|---
Poison Up | Increase poison damage.
Hawkeye | Increase debuff duration.

Debuff|Effect
---|---
Poison | Receive damage over time scaling to the caster's spirit stat.

Chaser | Receive follow-up damage for specific elements.
V1arious stat-downs | -
Debuff extension | Extends the duration of debuffs already on the target.

# Gacha
Gacha are split into mythril gacha and ticket gacha. In this game, you gacha for equipment, <a href="list-weapons.md">weapons</a> and <a href="list-armours.md">armours</a> specifically. There is a third type of equipment called medals (accessories) but are not from gacha, you do not have to worry about it for now.

## Mythril Gacha
Mythril is the premium currency in this game, where it is split into free mythril and paid mythril. Mythril gacha is always separated by jobs, meaning you will only get what the job can use.

The general gacha rate is as follows unless stated otherwise:

* Separated by job: 64% 3-star / 30% 4-star / 6% 5-star
* While the contents of 3-star and 4-star are more or less fixed (mostly fodders). The contents of 5-star vary from gacha to gacha.

*Gacha events change from time to time, the following is true for the time when this guide is written.*

Job Gacha/Fest

* 3% evenly distributed among WEAPONs released
* 3% evenly distributed among ARMOURs released
* Job Gacha is permanently available while Job Fest is an event
* During Job Fest, for doing a 10-pulls, the first pull will be a guaranteed 5-star, but only available once a day.
	* 50% evenly distributed among WEAPONS and ARMOURS released respectively

Elemental Fest

* Same as Job Gacha / Fest but contain only equipment for one specific element.
* Chance to get with EX weapons that can inherit 2 specials and 2 normal effects.

Box Gacha

* All new equipment pieces are launched in the form of Box Gacha.
* Contents of boxes may differ for collaboration events, depending on BDFE's mood at the moment.
* 126 3-star, 62 4-star, 8 5-star pieces in the pool.
* 5-star pieces (in general):
	* 1 New Weapon
	* 3 New Armours
	* 1 Old Weapon
	* 3 Old Armours
* Once a piece is pulled, it is removed from the pool. Rate for each piece is always 6% divided by number of remaining pieces.
* Once all pieces of a rarity are pulled, the rarity is removed from the equation. Otherwise, the rate always remains 64% : 30% : 6%.
* There is a red button below the pulling button named Reset. It resets the content of the box to before you start pulling. Only push if you want multiple copies of the same item.

Step Up (Currently obsolete)

* Like a set package of gacha. Freebies, guaranteed 5-star are offered as you pull more to complete the steps.
* May have special pools depending on the gacha. Currently, they are mostly slotted weapons step up (i.e. weapons with slot effects).
* Typically cost 300~500 mythril.
* There is a permanent beginner step-up but it is considered obsolete since other banners are better now.

Vintage Gacha

* The contents of 5-stars are all armours.
* Chance to get Wakoku/Bravo gears that can inherit 2 normal effects.
	* When a 5-star is pulled , 50% to get Wakoku/Bravo gears.
	* Chance is split among Hat/Chest/Pants for all 4 elements, i.e. 12 pieces.
* Rare chance to get time-limited recoloured 5-star armours as 4-star.
	* No practicality, simply for fashion

Paid Mythril

* (Permanent) Daily 1 pull per 5 paid mythril for Job Gacha, with regular rate
* (Event) Guaranteed 5-star per 150 paid mythril in Elemental Fest / Vintage.

## Ticket Gacha
The rate of ticket gacha is unpublished. Tickets in this game yield random items. You may not select a pool to use the tickets on. The currently released recurring tickets:

Ticket|Description
---|---
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/Nfy1RNQW.JPG" width="25" alt="Red"> | Used on specific job only, starting from 3-star.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/AkD1BwAI.JPG" width="25" alt="Blue"> | Able to select job, starting from 3-star.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/p7yDjLsZ.JPG" width="25" alt="Gold"> | Able to select job, starting from 4-star.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/hbwAox3w.JPG" width="25" alt="Pink"> | Able to select job, 5-star only.
<img src="https://caelum.s-ul.eu/8Ur4JKfw.JPG" width="25" alt="Green"> | Random jobs, 10 pulls per ticket.

Red and blue are the most common forms of tickets. Gold is received in events regularly, but pink and green are very rare. eku53ru logged the results of red and blue ticket pulls and have the following results: 82% 3-star / 15% 4-star / 3% 5-star.

## Beginner / Reroll

It is easier to get armors later on from boxes or Vintage gacha. Therefore, it is generally suggested to reroll for weapons. 

Reroll Suggestions:
* <a href="reroll-1.md">Knight</a>
* <a href="reroll-2.md">Black Mage</a>
* <a href="reroll-3.md">White Mage</a>
* <a href="reroll-4.md">Thief</a>
* <a href="reroll-5.md">Ranger</a>

Every new account starts with 10 random rolls for selected job with 1 guaranteed 5-star. There are also weapon-only and armour-only start-dash with guaranteed 5-star that can only be pulled using 75 paid Mythril. 1 time per job per type per account. The start-dash will only be available for 72 hours after account creation. It may be better to spend paid mythril in Vintage Gacha, however.

**Beginner Boost**: Please note that within one week of starting, there is a honeymoon period that you get boosted pq drop, rare encounters, item drop rate and EXP gain for a week. It is a good time to quickly catch up when the boost is still going on. 

[Gamepedia How to Reroll](https://fairyseffect.gamepedia.com/Reroll_Guide)

## Alchemy
Technically not a gacha but practically a gacha. There are three types of alchemy. It is not in the gacha tab but in the equipment upgrading tab.

4-star Alchemy

* Trade 3 4-star based pieces to get one random item of at least 4-star rarity.
* There is a low chance to upgrade to a random 5-star.
* Not recommended for beginners.

5-star Alchemy

# User Interface
[Gamepedia Beginner's Guide](https://fairyseffect.gamepedia.com/Beginner%27s_Guide) contains pictures and UI translations useful for non-Japanese speakers. It is a bit outdated, so this section is written to complement the outdated info (I am too lazy to redo everything). The information may be a bit overwhelming to try to remember all at once. Some functions are self-explanatory and some are explained further in the guides. Just check it out whenever you feel like exploring. Feel free to ask about anything unclear in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jCRBwmz).

Typically you are in town (named Al Khampis / イスタンタル lit. Istantal) unless you are taking part in something else such as quest, PVP or abyss. [**Town UI 1**](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/MYnu7mRJ.jpg); [**Town UI 2**](https://caelum.s-ul.eu/EpQafnHh.jpg).
